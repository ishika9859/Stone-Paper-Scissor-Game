# Stone-Paper-Scissor-Game

**Stone-Paper-Scissors Game (Persistent Score Tracker)**


An interactive Stone-Paper-Scissors web game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Local Storage support to retain scores even after page refresh.

## Overview

This project is a fun and engaging browser-based implementation of the classic Stone-Paper-Scissors game. The application allows users to play against the computer in real time with instant result feedback and score tracking. It also incorporates Local Storage to preserve game data, making the experience more realistic and user-friendly.


## Problem Statement

Many beginner game projects focus only on basic functionality and fail to provide continuity in user experience. A simple browser game becomes more engaging when user progress is retained and interactions feel consistent. The aim of this project is to build a visually appealing and responsive mini-game that delivers instant feedback, smooth interaction, and a more realistic gameplay experience.

## Tools and Technologies

* HTML – Structure of the game interface
* CSS – Styling, layout, and visual feedback
* JavaScript – Game logic and interactivity
* Local Storage  – Persistent score tracking

## Methods

* Random move generation for computer logic
* Event handling for user choices
* Conditional logic for determining winner
* Dynamic DOM updates for live score display
* Local Storage integration using `setItem()` and `getItem()`
* JSON handling for storing structured game data

## Key Insights

* Learned how to implement basic game logic using JavaScript
* Understood real-time UI updates through DOM manipulation
* Explored how Local Storage enhances user experience
* Practiced writing cleaner conditional logic
* Built an interactive and engaging mini-game from scratch

## Output

The final output is a fully functional browser-based game that includes:

* Playable Stone-Paper-Scissors gameplay
* Real-time result display (Win/Lose/Draw)
* Computer vs Player interaction
* Persistent score tracking after refresh
* Clean and responsive UI

## How to Run this project?

1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Ensure HTML, CSS, and JS files are in the same folder.
3. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
4. Start playing — your score will remain saved even after refresh.

## Results & Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how core web technologies can be used to build an interactive and enjoyable mini-game. By combining logic, UI updates, and persistent storage, the application delivers a more complete and practical front-end development experience.

## Future Work

* Add sound effects and animations
* Implement multiplayer mode
* Create leaderboard system
